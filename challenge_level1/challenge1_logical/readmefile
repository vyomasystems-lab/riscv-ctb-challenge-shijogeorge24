For this challenge the issue was wrong use of instruction

test.S: Assembler messages:
test.S:15855: Error: illegal operands `and s7,ra,z4'
test.S:25584: Error: illegal operands `andi s5,t1,s0'
make: *** [Makefile:4: compile] Error 1

1) error reason for illegal operands `and s7,ra,z4' is there is no register named z4 in ABI we could use s4 or t4

fix
    use any of the register s4 or t4

2) eroor reason for illegal operands `andi s5,t1,s0' in the ISA its we can use ANDI destination can be a register and source 1 canbe a register but source 2 has to be a immidate value


fix

    1)remove instruction from the code 
    2) find correct value os s0 at that stage and use it as immidiate value
